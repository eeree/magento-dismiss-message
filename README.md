# magento-dismiss-message
Module adds a [X] button (similar in look and behavior to ones, that you can find in Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation) to messages on a front page. Allows you to hide a message applying native browser animation effect (ease). This release adds support only for front messages (admin area in progress).
